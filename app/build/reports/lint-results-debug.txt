/Users/m4air/Documents/Projects/grain-camera-android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:3: Warning: WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is deprecated (and is not granted) when targeting Android 13+. If you need to write to shared storage, use the MediaStore.createWriteRequest intent. [ScopedStorage]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ScopedStorage":
   Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using
   requestLegacyExternalStorage). In particular, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE will
   no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent
   of READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE instead.

   As of Android 13, if you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media
   files on the shared storage, you should be using instead one or more new
   storage permissions:
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO

   and then add maxSdkVersion="33" to the older permission. See the developer
   guide for how to do this:
   https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granula
   r-media-permissions

   The MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can be used to manage all files, but
   it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use
   it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or
   delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described
   at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.

/Users/m4air/Documents/Projects/grain-camera-android/app/build.gradle.kts:21: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk = 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/m4air/Documents/Projects/grain-camera-android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26: Warning: This folder configuration (v26) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 26. Merge all the resources in this folder into mipmap-anydpi. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

<FrameLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
^

   Explanation for issues of type "MergeRootFrame":
   If a <FrameLayout> is the root of a layout and does not provide background
   or padding etc, it can often be replaced with a <merge> tag which is
   slightly more efficient. Note that this depends on context, so make sure
   you understand how the <merge> tag works before proceeding.

<vector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
^

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

/Users/m4air/Documents/Projects/grain-camera-android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml:1: Warning: The application adaptive icon is missing a monochrome tag [MonochromeLauncherIcon]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "MonochromeLauncherIcon":
   If android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in your manifest, you must
   either remove the reference to android:roundIcon if it is not needed; or,
   supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the android:roundIcon
   and android:icon attribute.

   For example, if android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in the
   manifest, a launcher might choose to use android:roundIcon over
   android:icon to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed
   application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also
   specified in android:roundIcon.

/Users/m4air/Documents/Projects/grain-camera-android/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:40: Warning: When you define paddingEnd you should probably also define paddingStart for right-to-left symmetry [RtlSymmetry]
                android:paddingEnd="8dp"/>
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RtlSymmetry":
   If you specify padding or margin on the left side of a layout, you should
   probably also specify padding on the right side (and vice versa) for
   right-to-left layout symmetry.
